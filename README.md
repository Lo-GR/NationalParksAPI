## _Description_ üìÉ
This project is a demo API intended to be used to practice front-end API usage for a message board application. This API contains a set of 30 test messages, each containing a Title, Body, Date, User, and an (optional) image URL to go with the message post. The application allows for creation of new posts, viewing of all posts, editing existing posts, and deleting posts, to emulate a real-world forum application. All posts are assigned a Group, which includes the ability to create new groups and view groups. See API use for further details.

### _Cloning and Initial Setup_

> Repository: https://github.com/Lo-GR/MessageBoard.Solution.git
1. In your terminal of choice or [GitHub's Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/), clone the above repository from Github. For further explanation on how to clone this repository, please visit [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).
2. Ensure you are running .NET Core SDK by using the command dotnet --version in your terminal. If a version number is not presented, please visit [this download page for .NET 5 and install the applicable software for your OS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0). 
3. Once you verify you are running a .NET 5, navigate in your terminal to MessageBoard directory within the MessageBoard.Solution directory you just cloned. Once there, run "dotnet build" in your terminal to build application within directory. 
4. You will require a text or code editor to complete the following steps. [VS Code is recommended](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. (optional)If changes to packages are required, add to csproj then run "dotnet restore." Also good for troubleshooting.


### _Installation: Database Recreation_

1. Ensure you are running MySQL Server 8 and MySQL WorkBench 8. If you are running windows, use the [Windows Installer ](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) for MySQL and follow the instructions provided by the installer. For Macs, visit [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and select macOS from the Operation Systems. This will be a manual installation. If you need additional assistance on this, please visit Epicodus's [Learn How to Program Article](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
2. Once you verify you have SQL installed, create a file called "appsettings.json" in the project directory MessageBoard. Paste the following into this file. Replace bracketed POST OF SERVER and PASSWORD OF SERVER with ports and password set up during MySQL installation.
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port={PORT OF SERVER};database=messageboard;uid=root;pwd={PASSWORD OF SERVER};"
  }
}
```
3. In the production directory "MessageBoard", run "dotnet ef database update" in your terminal.

## _API Use Guide_ ‚å®

### _API: Getting Started_

Note: It is recommend to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to practice API on. 

1. Back in your terminal in the MessageBoard production directory, type "dotnet run." The terminal will present local host routes for your dedicated API link. An example would be "http://localhost:5000." 
2. Keep the terminal running as it is being used to control the local server. When finished, exit the terminal or use the command "CTRL C"(Windows) or "CMD C"(Mac) to shut down the local server.

### _API End Points: Messages_

**Get all Endpoint** 
```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages
```
This link will pull a full list of all messages available in database. Dummy messages between 40-69, MessageId from 1-39 are purposely left blank due to migrations.

**Get messages by parameter Endpoint** 
```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages?parameter=string&parameter2=string
```
Available parameters: user, title, searchDate, startDate, endDate, body. See Query table below for more information.

**Get a message by its ID Endpoint**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages/id
```
Where `id` is the integer value of that message

**Post a new message to the board Endpoint**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages/{GroupId you'd like to post to}/createmessage
```

**Edit a message by username Endpoint**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages/username/id
```
where `username` is the username as a string, and `id` is the post id as an integer

Example of message body for Edit and Post endpoints
```
{
  "title": "TITLE OF MESSAGE",
  "body": "BODY OF MESSAGE",
  "date": "2021-01-13",
  "user": "USERNAME",
  "imageURL": "URL OF IMAGE RELATING TO IMAGE (optional)"

```
http://localhost:5000/api/messages/username/id
```
where `id` is the integer value of that message and `username` is the user of that message.

### _API End Points: Groups_

**Get all Endpoint** 
```
http://localhost:5000/api/groups
```
This link will pull a full list of all groups available in database, along with messages linked to those groups.

**Create a group Endpoint**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/groups
```

Example of body for Post endpoint

## _Preplanning/Whiteboard Work_ üìã
```
Expectations___
1. As a user, I want to be able to GET all messages related to a specific group.
2. As a user, I want to be able to POST messages to a specific group.
3. As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all groups.
4. As a user, I want to input date parameters and retrieve only messages posted during that timeframe.
5. As a user, I want to be able to PUT and DELETE messages, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)

API Functionality___
1. Make GET and POST routes for messages
  - Get route allows for all messages of group
  - Search Routes/Params for Get routes
2. PUT and DELETE route for messages.
3. Message Class
  - Title of Message
  - Body 
  - Date of Posting
  - User property for identity
  - Image URL
4. Identity implementation
5. ApplicationUser Class  
  - The whole identity sheabang
6. Solid README for those picking up api

Stretch Goal Ideas____
1. Replies class, one to many relationship to Message class

Frontend Functionality___
1. See list of all groups
```
